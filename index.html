        <p>A development professional for over 15 years, I started my career in Chicago, IL. at the Shedd Aquarium. I worked in the zoo and aquarium industry for nearly a decade and eventually found myself at the Denver Zoo. I was primarily a Membership expert...but slowly moved into the individual giving space and built intimate relationships to further the organizations mission. I currently work for DSST Public School as there Major Gifts officer.</p>
        <p>I have lived in Denver, CO for 8 years raising my two sons Michael and Henry. I enjoy hiking with my dog Lucy, skiing, biking (really anything outdoors), and competing in functional fitness competitions. I am thrilled and excited to be developing these new coding skills and look forward to applying them to my current work and beyond.</p>
